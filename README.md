## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies and Installation
**VRAM requirement**: Upscaling the provided toy example by 4x, with 72 frames, a width of 426, and a height of 240, requires around 39GB of VRAM using the default settings. If you encounter an OOM problem, you can set a smaller frame_length in inference_sr.sh. We recommend using a GPU with at least 24GB of VRAM to run this project. 

```
## git clone this repository

## üöÄ Inference

### Model Weight
| Base Model | Type | URL |
|------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I2VGen-XL | Light Degradation | [:link:](https://huggingface.co/SherryX/STAR/resolve/main/I2VGen-XL-based/light_deg.pt?download=true) |
| I2VGen-XL | Heavy Degradation | [:link:](https://huggingface.co/SherryX/STAR/resolve/main/I2VGen-XL-based/heavy_deg.pt?download=true) |
| CogVideoX-5B | Heavy Degradation | [:link:](https://huggingface.co/SherryX/STAR/tree/main/CogVideoX-5B-based) |

### 1. I2VGen-XL-based 
#### Step 1: Download the pretrained model STAR from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/SherryX/STAR).
We provide two versions for I2VGen-XL-based model, `heavy_deg.pt` for heavy degraded videos and `light_deg.pt` for light degraded videos (e.g., the low-resolution video downloaded from video websites).

You can put the weight into `pretrained_weight/`.

#### Step 2: Prepare testing data
You can put the testing videos in the `input/video/`.

As for the prompt, there are three options: 1. No prompt. 2. Automatically generate a prompt (e.g., [using Pllava](https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora/tree/main/tools/caption#pllava-captioning)). 3. Manually write the prompt. You can put the txt file in the `input/text/`.


#### Step 3: Change the path
You need to change the paths in `video_super_resolution/scripts/inference_sr.sh` to your local corresponding paths, including `video_folder_path`, `txt_file_path`, `model_path`, and `save_dir`.


#### Step 4: Running inference command
```
bash video_super_resolution/scripts/inference_sr.sh
```

### 2. CogVideoX-based
Refer to these [instructions](https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/STAR/tree/main/cogvideox-based#cogvideox-based-model-inference) for inference with the CogVideX-5B-based model.

Please note that the CogVideX-5B-based model supports only 720x480 input.
